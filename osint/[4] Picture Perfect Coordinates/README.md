# Description

my friend sent me this picture while i was setting the osint for this ctfâ€¦ however i cant find where this is, can you? provide coordinates to 4 decimal places (image credits: esme)
flag format: IRS{lat, long} to 4 decimal places
eg. if you think the answer is -43.513399672080894, 172.56175977009542,
the flag is IRS{-43.5133, 172.5617}
note: do open a ticket if you think you have the correct answer but the flag isnt correct
