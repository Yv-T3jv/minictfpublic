is this even in Singapore lol? what was the challenge author thinking
this is truly one of the imageS of all time. a serene pathway lined with towering trees and a curving road. but it aint as innocent as it seems. somewhere within this picture lies the key to the flag - coordinates to 4 decimal places. taKe a look at the skyline the trees the vegetatIon. you might see what you have never seen Before. perhaps with keen eyes you mIght spot some Dense vegetatIon that might lead you to the flag. good luck, explorer!
flag format: IRS{lat, long} to 4 decimal places
eg. if you think the answer is -43.513399672080894, 172.56175977009542,
the flag is IRS{-43.5133, 172.5617}
note: do open a ticket if you think you have the correct answer but the flag isnt correct
