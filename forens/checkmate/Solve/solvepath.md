# Key Steps / Observations

1. Using Aperi'Solve or a similar tool, realise that the PNG has an Alpha (transparency) channel.
2. Since MSB/LSB does not return anything useful, suspect that the flag is hidden in an Alpha bit plane (hinted at in the challenge description).
3. Use StegOnline or a similar tool to solve it as such.
